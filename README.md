# BootCamp-Data-Science-Aplicada-2021
In this repository it is possible to monitor my performance in the Aplied Data Science BootCamp from Alura (2021)

The 'Module' folders (ex.: Module_1) divide the Modules taken within the course.
Within each module are the notebooks I used to study. Most classes activities are concentrated on a single notebook since they use a single dataset. Classes with different datasets are on separate notebooks.
