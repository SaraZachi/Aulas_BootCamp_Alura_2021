In this repository it is possible to monitor my performance in the Aplied Data Science BootCamp from Alura (2021)
Each folder contains the notebooks of the activities performed in each module and the datasheets used.


# Module 1: Python and Pandas for Real Data Analysis
In this module, we learn how to use Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to explore SUS financial data, more precisely the expenses per Federal Unit over the years.

# Module 2: Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
In this module, we continue with the analysis of SUS financial data. We go deeper into data processing and manipulation for more complex analyses, using more advanced features of Pandas and the Python language as a whole. 

# Module 3: Time series analysis 
In this module we explore time series and study their particularities using the Prophet developed by Facebook.

# Module 4: Treatment, Analysis and Applied Machine Learning
In this module, we start the development of a practical project that will go through the entire workflow in Data Science, from understanding the problem, processing and analyzing the data to proposing a solution using Machine Learning. We work with COVID-19 data from Sírio Libanês Hospital, focusing on data treatment and analysis to deeply understand the problem we are dealing with and propose possible solutions.

# Module 5: Models, Metrics and Validations in Machine Learning
In this final module, we use all the acquired knowledge to analyze COVID-19 data, understand some of the challenges faced by hospitals during a pandemic period and propose solutions based on data analysis and Machine Learning. Here we use more advanced models, using appropriate metrics to solve the problem and correctly validating as needed. In this module we work on all these fronts to make our solution a viable proposal.
