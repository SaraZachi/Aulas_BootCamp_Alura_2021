# BootCamp-Data-Science-Aplicada-2021
In this repository it will be possible to monitor my performance in the Data Science Boot Camp from Alura (2021)

The 'Module' folders (ex.: Module_1) divide the Modules taken within the course.
Within each module are 'classes' folders (ex.: class_1) containing the Gist and .csv files used in each class.
